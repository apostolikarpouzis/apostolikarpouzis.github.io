My approach was inspired heavily by the Barbie Official Site. That was actually the first movie website I have seen and I thought it was a really cool place to just build excitement about a movie. I opened with the big "The Lord of the Rings" logo, so fans of the series felt at home, followed by a cinematic trailer. This is so the viewer opens the website and immediately hears and sees the trailer, locking them in and building excitement. Then I kept it simple and hyped up the movie, including awards and reviews it has collected. It also includes the soundtrack links which I took the time to actually make work (unlike other stuff that I cheaped out on bc finals :/) because fantasy lovers love their soundtracks as much as the film, and it won the oscar for best score ;). Basically, as you scroll you just hear more and more good about the movie, getting you to the point of wanting to watch it. I also included the case like you would see on Google, and I ended with a bunch of posters for people to share on their socials, but moreso the concept because I got lazy about making that work. 

Also I just wanted some more practice in html and js (CS student) so it was a nice way to combine my passion and this project!!
